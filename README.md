This project is a collection of three beginner-friendly Python applications that demonstrate the use of basic programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and user input handling.

1️⃣ Calculator

- A simple calculator program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes user
  input for numbers and the desired operation, then displays the result.

2️⃣ To-Do List

- A to-do list application where users can add tasks, view tasks, and manage their daily work. This program helps understand data storage using lists in Python and
  provides a simple way to organize tasks.

3️⃣ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

- An interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors, and the winner is decided
  based on standard game rules.
